# CV, NLP, and RL projects in CS 182: Designing, Visualizing and Understanding DNNs (spring 2020)

**This repository contains past projects I've completed in CS 182/282A, which I took in Berkeley EECS department under Prof. John Canny, in spring 2020.**

Followings are those projects and related materials covered/implemented in each project.

- **Project 1**
  - Implementing DNN's components (from scratch w/ numpy)
    - affine layer
    - activations (relu, leaky relu, sigmoid, elu)
    - convolutional layer
    - max pool, average pool
    - dropout / batchnorm
    - svm & softmax loss
  - Dropout
  - Batch Normalization
  - Convolutional Network on CIFAR-10
